You are a senior full-stack engineer. Build a minimal, production-ready MVP web app called **ResuMatch Pro**: an expert resume analyzer and job-fit tailor.

### Tech stack (opinionated)
- Backend: Python 3 + FastAPI
- Frontend: Jinja2 templates + HTMX for progressive enhancement + TailwindCSS (CDN)
- Auth: lightweight username-only login (no password yet)
- Storage: SQLite for users/sessions + local /uploads for files
- File handling: accept PDF, DOC/DOCX, PNG/JPG (with OCR)
- OCR/Parsing libs: pypdf or pdfplumber, python-docx (docx2txt fallback), pytesseract + pillow for images
- AI: Google Gemini via `google-generativeai` (env var `GEMINI_API_KEY`, default model `gemini-1.5-flash`)

### App goals (user flow)
1) **Landing/Login (`/`)**
   - Simple form: “Enter your name” → button [Continue]
   - On submit, create a user row (if not exists), set session cookie, redirect to `/dashboard`.
   - No password for now (we’ll add later). Show a tiny disclaimer: “Demo login (no password). Do not upload sensitive info.”

2) **Dashboard / Resume Upload (`/dashboard`)**
   - Card: “Upload your resume (PDF, DOC/DOCX, PNG/JPG).”
   - On upload, parse the file:
     - If DOCX: parse with `python-docx` or `docx2txt`.
     - If PDF: extract text via `pdfplumber`; basic layout preservation (newlines).
     - If image: OCR via `pytesseract` to text.
   - Store original file and extracted plaintext in DB linked to the user.
   - Buttons:
     - [Analyze with Gemini] → POST to `/analyze` (uses extracted text)
     - If no resume uploaded, disable the button with tooltip.

3) **AI Resume Analysis (`/analyze`)**
   - Call Gemini with a structured system prompt (below) to evaluate:
     - (A) **Completeness**: 0–100 score + rationale.
     - (B) **Section quality** (0–5 each) for:
       - Summary
       - Education
       - Experience
       - Other (projects/volunteering/awards/skills)
     - (C) **Gaps & suggestions**: bullet list, max 8 items, actionable and specific.
   - Render a results dashboard:
     - Big dial for completeness (0–100).
     - A small table for section scores with labels: Missing/Weak/Fair/Strong/Perfect mapped from 0–5.
     - Bulleted “Top improvement suggestions.”
   - Save the structured JSON response in DB.

   **Gemini prompt for analysis (send as system + user content):**
